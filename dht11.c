/* driver for DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor
 *
 * https://akizukidenshi.com/download/ds/aosong/DHT11_20180119.pdf
 *
 * // TODO: info
 *
 * give 1 second from powerup
 * do not read within 2 second of last read
 * data is from last read, `read, wait 2s, read` to get data from 2 seconds ago
 * note sensors may take up to 10 seconds to reflect air values (12 seconds ago
 * from read)
 *
 *

 * temp is in decidegree Celsius (10th's of degree Celsius)
 * humidity is in integer % relative
 *
 *
 * Example usage:
 *  struct dht_resp ht;
 *  while (dht_read(&ht, DDD0) < 0) {
 *      // wait 1 second if read is bad, then try again
 *      _delay_ms(1000);
 *      // optionally may want to exit incase of multiple consecutive failed
 *      // reads to prevent getting stuck indefinitly
 *  }
 *  // do something if temp is over 22C
 *  if (ht.temp > 2200) {
 *      foo();
 *  }
